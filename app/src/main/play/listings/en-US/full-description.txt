launch is a fast, productive and easy-to-use launcher for android

features
--------
  - launch apps instantly with patterns: as fast as your typing allows you to
    be
  - assign long-press shortcuts to quickly access apps.
  - easy on eyes
  - no icons, distractions, clutter/bloat, etc
  - lightweight and efficient
  - not just visual minimalism like most other minimalist launchers,
    but technical minimalism too.
  - open-source
  - uses at least ~10x less space than even the *minimalist* launchers

functions
---------
  - use search keys to create a filter word which shows only the filtered apps
  - click on an app to launch it
  - long-press on an app to launch it's system settings
  - press back button to clear the last character of the search word
  - long-press on the back button to refresh the app list (to reflect
    deletion/addition of apps)
  - long-press on a search key to launch/assign a shortcut app.

how does it work
----------------
  - keys on the left and right side are for searching, and the middle section
    shows the apps installed
  - start searching by using the search keys
  - if the search word only has one final matching app in the list, it will
    be opened automatically
  - to quickly launch an app, find a unique combination of alphabets
    which can launch it. for example, if "K-9 Mail" is the only app which has
    a "9" in it in my app list, then it can be launched just by pressing
    the "9" search key
  - assign an app to a search key by long-pressing on the search key. this
    assignment can be removed and/or modified.

goals
-----
  - launch aims for the following:
    - maximum compatibility (supports android >=5.0)
    - do more with less
    - ethical correctness (no ads/trackers)
    - stick to the UNIX philosophy (do one thing and do it well)
